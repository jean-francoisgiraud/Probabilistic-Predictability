# Probabilistic-Predictability
Probabilistic Predictibility from Parametric Data 

Is your data parametric i.e. does it have probabilistic predictability?
Can you prove it? How? (4 tests)

IF the four tests (assumptions) are true 
(1) a random sample from a population with
(2) a fixed location [mean] with 
(3) a fixed distribution [a relatively constant type of distribution such as a the normal distribution (bell curve) ] and 
(4) with a fixed variation [a relatively constant standard deviation]
THEN the data is parametric [it has a known distribution] AND
THEN probabilistic predictability is achieved, the process is in statistical control, repeatable and can be modeled [Yi=C+Ei=average+error] to make scientifically/legally valid predictions and conclusions [based on probability], for example: data will be Y +/- error 19 out of 20 times.  
Control limits can be established and outliers determined/rejected, otherwise all data is significant, non-onforming results cannot be rejected arbitrarily, they must be rejected on the basis of data in a statistically controlled process.
ELSE the process is unpredictable, out of control, drifting and no conclusions-judgements [past] or predictions [future] can be made, repeating the tests will yield different and unrelated results [there could be other unknown and unknowable variables not accounted for]

Predictability is an all-important goal in science and engineering. If the four underlying assumptions hold (random-sampling constant(average variation distribution)), then we have achieved probabilistic predictability--the ability to make probability statements not only about the process in the past, but also about the process in the future. In short, such processes are said to be "in statistical control".
If the four assumptions are valid, then the process is amenable to the generation of valid scientific and engineering conclusions. If the four assumptions are not valid, then the process is drifting (with respect to random-sampling, location=average, variation=StandardDeviation, or distribution), unpredictable, and out of control. A simple characterization of such processes by a location estimate, a variation estimate, or a distribution estimate inevitably leads to conclusions that are not valid, are not supportable (scientifically or legally), and which are not repeatable in the laboratory.
Because the validity of the final conclusions is inextricably linked to the validity of the underlying univariate assumptions, it naturally follows that there is a real necessity that each and every one of the above four assumptions be routinely tested.
Extremes in data do not necessarily mean that they are due to a special cause [especially if the process is not in statistical control]. They can still be part of the normal variation of the process.

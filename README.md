# Probabilistic-Predictability

- Predictability is a requirement in science engineering justice. If the four assumptions hold (random-sampling with constant (average variation distribution)), then we have achieved probabilistic predictability (the ability to make probability statements about the process in the past and about the process in the future). Such processes are said to be "in statistical control".
- If the four assumptions are valid, then the process can be modeled and used to generate valid scientific and engineering conclusions. 
- If the four assumptions are not valid, then the process is drifting (with respect to random-sampling, location=average, variation=StandardDeviation, or distribution), unpredictable, and out of control. A simple characterization of such processes by a location estimate, a variation estimate, or a distribution estimate inevitably leads to conclusions that are not valid, are not supportable (scientifically or legally), and which are not repeatable in the laboratory (these types of invalid claims are often made by people who do not understand statistics and rely instead on personal opinions or stereotyping (what seems or 'feels' right)) (note-1).
- Each of the four assumptions must be routinely tested to verify the continuous validity of the recommendationas and conclusions.
- Extremes in data do not necessarily mean that they are due to a special cause (especially if the process is not in statistical control). They can still be part of the normal variation of the process.

- Notes: 
- note-1: Stereotyping is a type of heuristic that people use instead of data and statisitical analysis to form opinions or make judgments about things they have never seen or experienced. They work as a mental shortcut to assess everything from the social status of a person based on their actions to assumptions that a plant that is tall, has a trunk, and has leaves is a tree even though the person making the evaluation has never seen that particular type of tree before. Stereotypes are the pictures people have in their heads that are built around experiences as well as what we are told about the world.

Probabilistic Predictibility from Parametric Data 

Is your data parametric i.e. does it have probabilistic predictability?
Can you prove it? How? (4 tests)

IF the four tests (assumptions) are true 

- (1) a random sample from a population with
- (2) a fixed location [mean] with 
- (3) a fixed distribution [a relatively constant type of distribution such as a the normal distribution (bell curve) ] and 
- (4) with a fixed variation [a relatively constant standard deviation]

THEN the data is parametric [it has a known distribution] AND

THEN probabilistic predictability is achieved, the process is in statistical control, repeatable and can be modeled [Yi=C+Ei=average+error] to make scientifically/legally valid predictions and conclusions [based on probability], for example: data will be Y +/- error 19 out of 20 times.  Control limits can be established and outliers determined/rejected, otherwise all data is significant, non-onforming results cannot be rejected arbitrarily, they must be rejected on the basis of data in a statistically controlled process.

ELSE the process is unpredictable, out of control, drifting and no conclusions-judgements [past] or predictions [future] can be made, repeating the tests will yield different and unrelated results [there could be other unknown and unknowable variables not accounted for]


# The four tests are: 
- Run sequence: the fixed variation assumption is true if vertical spread is the same over entire x axis [there is minimal bends in the trend line]) and the fixed location assumption is true if the run sequence plot [trend line = mean and] is flat and non-drifting.
- Histogram: the fixed normal distribution is true if bell shaped, other shapes may indicate other type of distribution.
- Lag plot: the randomness assumption is true if it is structureless and random.
- Normal probability plot: the fixed distribution assumption is true if linear, a straight line means the data is normally distributed.
